        <p>
          This Privacy Notice and Terms of Use (this “Notice”) applies to information collected through
          open house sign-in sheets, digital forms, QR code forms, and related follow-up communications
          used by Dennis Fotopoulos, a licensed New Jersey real estate professional and Broker Associate
          affiliated with Heritage House Sotheby’s International Realty.
        </p>

        <p>
          By signing in at an open house or submitting your information through a related form,
          you acknowledge and agree to this Notice.
        </p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          When you sign in at an open house, we may collect information you provide such as your name,
          email address, phone number, buying or selling timeframe, property interests, and any comments
          you choose to share. For digital sign-ins, we may also collect basic technical information such
          as date and time of entry and device type.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
          We may use the information collected to verify attendance, provide information about the
          property you viewed, follow up regarding your interest in buying, selling, or renting real
          estate, share relevant listings or market updates, and comply with legal and professional
          obligations. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>Sharing of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with Heritage House
          Sotheby’s International Realty for brokerage and compliance purposes, with service providers
          that support operations such as CRM and email delivery, and where required by law or to
          protect rights and safety.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Retention and Security</h3>
        <p>
          We retain open house sign-in information only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the
          purposes described in this Notice and to comply with legal and professional recordkeeping
          requirements. We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect
          your information.
        </p>

        <h3>No Obligation or Agency Relationship</h3>
        <p>
          Signing in at an open house does not create a client relationship, agency relationship, or
          obligation on your part. Representation is established only through a separate written
          agreement. If the property is currently listed with another real estate broker, any follow-up
          communication is not intended to solicit that listing.
        </p>

        <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Open houses and related sign-in forms are not intended for children under 13 years of age,
          and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to This Notice</h3>
        <p>
          We may update this Notice from time to time. The Effective Date above reflects the most recent
          revision.
