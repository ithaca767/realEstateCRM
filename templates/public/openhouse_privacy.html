        <p class="mb-2">
          This Privacy Notice and Terms of Use (this “Notice”) applies to information collected through open house sign-in sheets,

        <p class="mb-3">

        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Information We Collect</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          When you sign in at an open house, we may collect information you provide such as your name, email address, phone number,
          current address, buying or selling timeframe, property interests, and any comments or questions you choose to share.
          For digital sign-ins, we may also collect basic technical information such as date and time of entry and device type,
          where applicable.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">How We Use Your Information</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We may use the information collected to verify attendance at the open house, provide information about the property you viewed,
          follow up regarding your interest in buying, selling, or renting real estate, share information about similar properties, market
          updates, or real estate services that may be relevant to you, and comply with legal, regulatory, and professional obligations.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          You may opt out of marketing communications at any time by contacting us directly or using any unsubscribe option provided.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Sharing of Information</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We do not sell your personal information.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-2">
          <li>With Heritage House Sotheby’s International Realty for brokerage, compliance, and transaction-related purposes.</li>
          <li>With cooperating brokers, attorneys, lenders, inspectors, title companies, or other service providers, but only if you request or initiate a real estate transaction.</li>
          <li>With service providers who assist with systems such as data storage, CRM tools, and email delivery, solely to support business operations.</li>
          <li>When required by law, court order, or governmental request, or to protect legal rights and safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Data Retention and Security</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We retain open house sign-in information only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Notice
          and to comply with legal and professional recordkeeping requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission
          or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Children’s Privacy</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Open houses and related sign-in forms are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">No Obligation or Agency Relationship</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Signing in at an open house does not create a client relationship, agency relationship, or obligation on your part. Representation
          is established only through a separate written agreement. If the property is currently listed with another real estate broker, any
          follow-up communication is not intended to solicit that listing.
        </p>

        <h5 class="mt-3">Changes to This Notice</h5>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We may update this Notice from time to time. The Effective Date above reflects the most recent revision.
