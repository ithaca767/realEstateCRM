# ULYSSES CRM v1.0 Execution Checklist (Local to Production)

This checklist is intended to be followed in order. It enforces the v1.0 Release Manifest scope and keeps the work disciplined.

---

## 0. Pre-flight
- [ ] Confirm you are working locally (local code + local DB).
- [ ] Pull latest `main` locally.
- [ ] Do not expand scope beyond `v1.0_release_manifest.md`.

---

## 1. Create release branch
- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git pull`
- [ ] `git checkout -b release/v1.0.0`

---

## 2. Implement only the manifest items
After each item:
- [ ] Run locally
- [ ] Manually verify the behavior
- [ ] Commit with a small, clear message

Suggested sequence:

### Engagements and follow-ups
- [X ] Fix: Editing an engagement returns to the Engagements tab (not Details).
- [X ] Fix: Follow-ups are not marked overdue until the due time has passed.
- [X ] Fix: Add pagination to Engagements list (page numbers).

### Tasks
- [ ] Fix: edit_task shows contact name instead of Contact #X.
- [ ] Change: Tasks page defaults to OPEN tasks.

### Dashboard navigation
- [ ] Fix: Dashboard overview cards link to their pages.
- [ ] Fix: Recent Engagements on Dashboard link to the contact record.
- [ ] Add: Add Contact button on Active Contacts card (button only).

### UI polish (layout and CSS only)
- [ ] Layout: Engagement list shows follow-up and related tags in their own column.
- [ ] Layout: Prevent action-button wrapping; isolate horizontal scrolling outside action columns.
- [ ] UI tweak: Contacts tab order so All appears after Imported.

---

## 3. Update version to v1.0.0
- [ ] Update the app version constant and footer display to show **v1.0.0**.
- [ ] Commit: `Bump version to v1.0.0`

---

## 4. Local regression pass (quick)
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Contacts list loads
- [ ] Edit contact loads and tabs behave as expected
- [ ] Engagements tab: create, edit, save returns to Engagements tab
- [ ] Follow-ups: due today but later time is not marked overdue
- [ ] Engagements pagination works
- [ ] Tasks: list defaults to OPEN; edit shows contact name
- [ ] Dashboard links work; Recent Engagement navigates to correct contact
- [ ] No ugly button wrapping or horizontal scroll issues in touched tables

---

## 5. Merge to main and push
- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git pull`
- [ ] `git merge --no-ff release/v1.0.0`
- [ ] `git push`

---

## 6. Production deploy and verify
- [ ] Trigger deployment from `main` (Render workflow).
- [ ] Run the same regression checklist in production.

Security preference reminder:
- Do not print full DB URLs or secrets to terminal or chat.
- Redact credentials when verifying env vars.

---

## 7. Tag the release
- [ ] `git tag v1.0.0`
- [ ] `git push --tags`

---

## 8. Close the release branch (optional)
- [ ] Delete the release branch locally and on origin once stable.
