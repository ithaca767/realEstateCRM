# ULYSSES CRM

## Release Manifest – v1.1.0

**Release Line:** Phase 8.1 – AI-Assisted Engagement Intelligence  
**Release Type:** Minor version (non-breaking, additive)  
**Current Production Baseline:** v1.0.3  
**Status:** Planned / In Design

---

## 1. Purpose of This Release

Ulysses v1.1.0 introduces **optional, user-initiated AI assistance** to support clarity, memory, and professional judgment within the Engagement workflow.

This release does **not** automate decisions, communications, or workflows.  
It augments the agent’s ability to *think clearly about their own conversations*.

v1.1.0 is the first release in which Ulysses incorporates AI as a **tool for cognition**, not as an automation engine.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles (Reaffirmed)

This release explicitly adheres to the **Ulysses AI Principles**, including:

* Explicit user intent
* Human-in-the-loop control
* Transparency of AI involvement
* No silent background processing
* No autonomous actions
* Full reversibility
* Cost awareness

AI assists **documentation and reflection**, never judgment or authority.

---

## 3. Feature Summary

### 3.1 AI-Assisted Engagement Transcript Summarization

**Description**  
Allows a user to generate structured summaries from pasted engagement transcripts or long-form notes using the OpenAI API.

**Location**  
Engagement detail view

**Trigger**  
User-initiated only  
Explicit “Summarize transcript” action

---

## 4. Functional Scope (v1.1.0)

### Inputs

* User-pasted transcript or long-form interaction text
* No automatic ingestion
* No metadata inference required

### Outputs

AI returns **three distinct outputs**, clearly labeled:

1. **One-Sentence Summary**

   * Factual, neutral, chronological
   * Designed for quick scanning and timelines

2. **Full CRM Narrative Summary**

   * CRM-ready prose
   * Chronological
   * First-person where appropriate
   * No speculation or advice

3. **Suggested Action Items (Optional)**

   * Clearly labeled as suggestions
   * Never auto-created as Tasks
   * User decides what, if anything, to act on

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

v1.1.0 explicitly does **not** include:

* Automatic engagement creation
* Automatic task creation
* Automatic email drafting or sending
* Background or scheduled AI processing
* Buyer/seller inference
* Sentiment analysis
* Deal risk scoring
* Contact or transaction state changes
* Cross-engagement pattern analysis

If the user does not click the action, **nothing happens**.

---

## 6. Persistence & Data Integrity

* Original user-supplied text is preserved unchanged
* AI output is **not saved** until explicitly confirmed by the user
* User may edit or discard AI output entirely
* No AI-generated content is written silently to the database

This ensures:

* Legal defensibility
* Historical accuracy
* User trust

---

## 7. Opt-In & Controls

### User Controls

* AI features disabled by default
* Explicit opt-in required at account or feature level
* Clear disclosure at point of use

### System Controls

* Backend enforcement of opt-in state
* Daily and monthly usage limits
* Hard usage caps to prevent surprise billing
* Usage metering aligned to OpenAI token consumption

---

## 8. Cost Model

* OpenAI API usage is token-based and metered
* Costs scale linearly with usage
* Expected usage falls in low tens of dollars per month for heavy users
* No per-user licensing cost
* No hidden fees

AI functionality is designed to become a **paid add-on** in future releases, separate from the core CRM license.

---

## 9. Compatibility & Risk Assessment

### Backward Compatibility

* Fully backward compatible
* No schema changes required for core functionality
* No impact on users who do not opt in

### Risk Profile

* Low technical risk (isolated, internal)
* No external system dependencies
* No brokerage or compliance coupling
* No impact on existing workflows

---

## 10. Versioning Rationale

This release is designated **v1.1.0** because it:

* Introduces a meaningful new capability
* Is additive and non-breaking
* Does not alter core workflows
* Preserves product stability
* Signals maturity and confidence

This is **not** an experimental or beta feature line.

---

## 11. Future Considerations (Not Commitments)

Potential future extensions (v1.2+) may include:

* AI-assisted email drafting
* Document summarization (inspection reports)
* Engagement preparation briefs
* Pattern reflection across a user’s CRM history

None of the above are included in v1.1.0.

---

## 12. Canon Statement

> *Ulysses v1.1 introduces optional AI assistance to help agents clarify and preserve the meaning of their own conversations. AI in Ulysses supports human judgment; it does not automate decisions, communications, or workflows.*
