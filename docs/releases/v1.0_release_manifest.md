# ULYSSES CRM v1.0 Release Manifest

**Release goal:** Ship a stable, externally usable v1.0 focused on correctness, clarity, and trust.  
**Scope rule:** Bug fixes and low-risk UI and navigation polish only. No new workflows, no schema-expanding features unless required to fix a bug.  
**Out of scope:** Anything not explicitly listed below.

---

## Included in v1.0

### Bucket 1: Engagements and follow-ups (bug fixes only)
- Fix: Editing an engagement returns to the Engagements tab (not Details).
- Fix: Follow-ups are not marked overdue until the due time has passed (datetime-aware logic).
- Fix: Pagination added to the Engagements list (page numbers).

### Bucket 2: Tasks (correctness and defaults)
- Fix: edit_task shows contact name instead of Contact #X.
- Change: Tasks page defaults to OPEN tasks.

### Bucket 7: Dashboard (navigation only)
- Fix: Dashboard overview cards link to their respective pages.
- Fix: Recent Engagements on the Dashboard link to the contact record.
- Add: Add Contact button on the Active Contacts card (button only, no new logic).

### Bucket 8: UI polish (layout and CSS only)
- Layout: Engagement list shows follow-up and related tags in their own column (no behavior change).
- Layout: Prevent action-button wrapping; isolate horizontal scrolling outside action columns.
- UI tweak: Contacts tab order updated so All appears after Imported.
