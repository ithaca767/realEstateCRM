# Ulysses CRM – AI Philosophy

## Purpose

This document defines the governing philosophy for all AI functionality within **Ulysses CRM**. It establishes clear boundaries, design principles, and non‑negotiable rules that ensure AI enhances human work without replacing judgment, intent, or accountability.

This philosophy is considered **canon**. Any future AI feature must comply with the principles below or be explicitly rejected.

---

## Core Principle

> **AI may assist with expression, but never with intent, memory, or action.**

This single rule underpins every AI decision in Ulysses CRM.

* **Expression**: wording, summarization, clarity, structure
* **Intent**: goals, decisions, strategy
* **Memory**: what actually happened, historical record
* **Action**: tasks, follow‑ups, scheduling, commitments

AI is permitted only in the first category.

---

## What AI Is In Ulysses

AI in Ulysses is:

* **Assistive** – it helps the user articulate information
* **On‑demand** – it runs only when explicitly triggered
* **Human‑final** – a person decides what is saved
* **Visible** – outputs are shown before any action
* **Reversible** – nothing is written unless manually pasted and saved

AI exists to reduce friction, not to automate judgment.

---

## What AI Is Not

AI in Ulysses is **not**:

* Autonomous
* Background‑running
* Self‑saving
* Opinionated
* Strategic
* Authoritative

AI does not “decide,” “schedule,” “optimize,” or “correct.”

---

## Explicitly Prohibited Uses

The following uses of AI are disallowed within Ulysses CRM:

### 1. Automatic Database Writes

AI must never:

* Save summaries automatically
* Modify notes in the background
* Rewrite historical records
* Perform silent updates of any kind

All persistence must be the result of a human action.

---

### 2. AI‑Created Tasks or Follow‑Ups

AI may not:

* Create tasks
* Schedule reminders
* Mark follow‑ups as required or completed

At most, AI may **suggest** follow‑up items in a preview context. Creation is always manual.

---

### 3. Reinterpretation of Tone or Intent

AI must not:

* Add emotional framing
* Soften or escalate language
* Infer motivations
* Recast client sentiment

Summarization must remain factual and neutral.

---

### 4. Pricing, Offer, or Strategy Guidance

AI may not:

* Recommend prices or counters
* Judge deal strength
* Assess client seriousness
* Offer strategic advice

Ulysses is a system of record, not a decision engine.

---

### 5. Cross‑Contact or Behavioral Analysis

AI may not:

* Profile clients
* Compare contacts
* Analyze behavior across engagements
* Draw conclusions from historical patterns

AI operates at the **single‑engagement level only** unless explicitly re‑authorized by canon.

---

## Approved AI Use Cases

The following are explicitly allowed:

* Drafting engagement summaries
* Cleaning raw transcripts into readable narrative
* Producing one‑sentence recap lines
* Suggesting possible follow‑up items (non‑binding)

All outputs must be previewed before use.

---

## Time‑Shifted Intelligence

Ulysses supports **time‑shifted AI assistance**:

* Capture first
* Refine later
* Improve records intentionally

AI is available when the user is ready, not when the system decides.

---

## Design Guardrails

Every AI feature must satisfy all of the following:

* Explicit user opt‑in
* Global kill switch
* Per‑user usage limits
* No background execution
* No implicit saves
* Clear attribution (AI vs human)

If any guardrail cannot be met, the feature must not ship.

---

## Rationale

Ulysses CRM is trusted with:

* Sensitive conversations
* Incomplete thoughts
* High‑stress negotiations
* Long‑term historical memory

AI that crosses boundaries erodes trust, even if technically correct.

A restrained, predictable AI makes the system stronger.

---

## Canon Status

This document is **binding**.

Any future AI expansion must:

* Reference this philosophy
* Justify alignment
* Explicitly call out any deviation

Absent that justification, the default answer is **no**.

*End of document.*
